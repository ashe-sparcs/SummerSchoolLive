    <h4>Description of Education 3.0 Courses</h4>
    <h5>The Process</h5>
{#    The process 의 첫 문단#}
    <p>No formal lectures. The professor in charge assigns the topic each week. The professor provides pre-recorded lectures and reference materials via Internet. Students learn by listening to pre-recorded lectures delivered by the KAIST Education 3.0 professors, from reference materials available on the Internet, and by performing simple experiments.</p>
{#    The process 의 두번째 문단#}
    <p>Students communicate with the Education 3.0 Consulting Professors in other countries through the Internet and Skype when they have questions on the lecture materials. Students consult with the local KAIST faculty when they have questions after listening the pre-recorded lectures. Students formally get together with the faculty advisor and fellow students once a week to review what they have done.</p>
    <h5>Benefits of Edu 3.0</h5>
